# super-garbanzo

"Super Garbanzo" is the name GitHub suggested. My individual project for 2/10/2016 will be a "poetry garden" where users can publish their own poems or share those in the public domain, favorite other's poems and collect their favorites in a list. It is a very simple Rails application that will make use of the httparty gem and the PoetryDB API.
